As a former Haskeller, let me share my feelings about Rust. Rust Language is very powerful, but the reason why I am not interested in this language is:
1. There are many business logic in the world that require creativity and programming flow experience, and the Rust compiler always interrupts your directional thinking,
forcing you to focus on unimportant details during the design phase, losing a lot of programming fun.

2. The people in the Rust community seem to have no understanding of market economy and cost concepts. A good software is not only about memory security and absolute performance, code readability, scenario suitability, deep understanding, and continuous maintenance, 
but also valuable to users. Rewriting a software proves that Rust is faster and more powerful than other languages, and software that is immediately abandoned has no value.

3. The Rust community values the delicate control of memory, which is sometimes just as annoying as C++developers. They use pointers or lifecycle control capabilities as a way to show off, and Rust is more like a tool to prove that they are better than others.
I'm not saying that Rust is bad, but I don't like the idea of thinking that Rust is the best in the world and that everything needs to be rewritten with Rust.

4. Rust's mandatory memory management, when writing complex logic, the compiler interrupts too rigidly, which makes people unable to quietly think about the most important architecture design.
Rust is suitable for scenarios that do not require GC or require strict performance, such as low-level libraries or real-time performance. For memory security, it can tolerate compiler rigor.
However, in most real-world scenarios, memory security is not always prioritized, but creativity and logical clarity are prioritized.
